1. add zooming option in 2d 
2. Add more ui freidnyl option in both 2d and 3d renderer like zoom were I click my mouse, maybe like how it happens in cad softwares 
3. logic issue when new shape function or error function or dome function is being entered: So I still feel although slightly smooth, the jump is insane speciafically when shape function or dome function is entered, its very abrupt and not as smooth I want it to be, I want it to be very very very smooth 
4. simulation should stop when the dome function creates teh smallest possible cross section 
5. the reset function doesnt reset teh 3d renderer 
6. also in certain shape and dome cases, the 2d renderer window starts flashing, and like idk something starts working abnormally, everything else works just fine, even the 2d visuallzation I feel is working fine, but its very fast random flashing of the window



next set to improvements:
G-code: The provided generator is simple and assumes absolute coordinates and a single extruder; tune extrusionFactor for your real printer or post-process the .gcode.

ILC z-learning: right now we add a placeholder z-correction storage; to actually learn z-corrections you need a z-sensor and to feed z-errors into completeIteration() loop same as xy. I can add that hook next if you want.

Performance: streaming points with usleep(500) makes rendering visible. Increase stream rate or send in batches to speed up.

Robustness: If shape vertex counts differ, morpher wraps indices using modulo to avoid crashes. For better accuracy you can resample shapes to a common vertex count.

1. dome on top of any user input shapes, if current input shape is square, and then dome command is sent it should make domes on top of sqaure (in 2d) and 3d domes on top of cuboidal structures. And this can be any other shape, cross section can be a star an ellipse, and domes should be made on top of 3d layers with cross section of those shapes and not just circles, currently it just works on circle, and even if I send dome command, it switches to circle... I do understand domes are cirular but, thats the goal, map the previous shapes to domes, smoothly transition from going in square path to building domes, use maths, geometry idk what but something
2. renderer seems to be designed only for spirals, which I said not the case always, we may have a square, star, ellipse shape or any other shape, you have to understand we are not only simulating the motion of the robot (which is similar to tool tip of a 3d printer) we want to simulate what its building, the 2 consecutive path of robot should be filled with some material and thats how we have to simulate, not just motion of robot, but also what its making.
3. rendering cap is 150 points right now, we need to go beyond that, no cap.
4. once it starts, it starts with set path and it does what it does, not differnce, the difference will come only when mid simulation (not stopped) new shape command is entered, so now the new shape command is now the reference path to be followed, and the previous and current shape that the robot is tracing becoems the observeed path, and now run ILC on this, so it smoothly transitions into the new shape entered 
5. renderer window as well as 2d simulation is not properly scaled
6. I want you to generate G code of the path followed at every instance, so we can run the 3d render simulation later and even I can feed this to a 3d printer (the g code) to see if it works as it is intended to
